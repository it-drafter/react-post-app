# REACT Post App

This is a basic posting app built with REACT.

In this mini-project, I used:
- functional 'arrow' components
- useState, useEffect and useRef hooks
- 'axios' library to work with GET, POST and DELETE requests,
- Firebase Realtime Database to store the data
- 'REACT Spinners' library for the 'Loader' component
- 'moment' library to make working with dates as easy as possible
- a touch of Bootstrap styling

## Demo
